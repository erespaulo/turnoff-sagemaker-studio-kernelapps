# turnoff-sagemaker-studio-kernelapps
Python code to provide a solution to delete kernel apps forgoteen by your cientists


I came across some solutions for Iddle notebooks within Sagemaker created and available by AWS itself in the community, but they did not include Kernel Apps (which generate costs), but they included JupyterServer.

Impacting the creation of user profiles and generating errors.

In this way, we searched for the AWS SDK and developed the script with Python to solve the customized need.
